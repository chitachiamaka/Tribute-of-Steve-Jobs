<strong> Steve Jobs</strong><br><br>
What ompact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story I've writtedas an adult 
( and certainly everyone that has been published),almost every email I've ever written,
has been written on machines created by Apple. 
I interacted online using an Apple machine long befor I ever encountered
a PC. Steve Jobs heled to realize the star Trek futurebi dreamed of as a kid.
And through his vission, I have been able to reaize my own. You'lled mssed, Mr. Jobs. 
Thanks for all your amazing work.<br><br>

        <strong>He's Gone</strong><br><br>
        A part of my heart has cracked.
        I didn't known personally but I felt like I
        knew him. i will fovrebremember him. I'm saddened because he was 
        taken too soon. I can only imagine his struggles. Heaven has certainly
        gained an angle.<br><br>
